    "\n",
    "- GANs were introduced in 2014, considered a groundbreaking development in AI.\n",
    "- Triggered discussions on the creativity of computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GAN Components\n",
    "- **Two Networks:** GANs consist of two networks - a generator and a discriminator.\n",
    "- **Generator's Role:** Generates new data.\n",
    "- **Discriminator's Role:** Determines if the data is genuine or fake.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working Mechanism\n",
    "- **Adversarial Process:** Generator creates data, discriminator evaluates its authenticity.\n",
    "- **Iterative Training:** Discriminator receives both real and fake data alternately.\n",
    "- **Competition:** Networks compete as the generator tries to improve, and the discriminator aims to become more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Post-Training Outcome\n",
    "- **Divergent Purposes:** After training, generator and discriminator have distinct roles.\n",
    "- **Generator's Use:** Mainly for creating new content.\n",
    "- **Discriminator's Use:** Useful for detecting AI-generated content (e.g., fake news)."
